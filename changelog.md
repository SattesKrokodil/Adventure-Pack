# CHANGELOG

## ! Unreleased !

### Updates
+ added recipes for: porkchop, chicken, beef, arrow, phantom membrane, spell reset potion (until fixed by AoE), egg, sheep spawn egg, cow spawn egg, pig spawn egg (reason: in later stages of the pack animals get rare around spawn -> very hard for new players to start on a running server. Also fixes food balance issues between enderling and exiled.)
